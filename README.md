# Dawgy

Prototype for a Tinder-like app. Wanted to experiment with UI and architecting the data needed to pull something like this off. Also, was very good practice with the latest version of React, especially hooks!

## Takeaway

- Rapid prototyping
- Calls a public API ([https://dog.ceo/dog-api/](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/))
- Single page application
- UI/UX/interaction practice
- React v16.8 (hooks, baby!)
- State management and data architecture
